Android development 'good enough' framework/scaffold for disposable solutions.

We don't plan nor do we want this to catch the eyes of every developer under the sun, this is simply a range of tooling that has been an invaluable foundation for getting projects off the  ground.

## Motivation
In extremly tight teams the speed of which you have to deliver software is king but we have to ensure that code is of a high enough standard that it is suitable for production. 

Lower human resouces tends to yield increases of speed of implementation and agile benefits. This has the potiential for daily release cycles to resolve bugs and issues in a production environment. In addition developers in these environments tend to quickly gain full-stack expertise with a problem solving mindset.

The bad side of this appoach is that corners are easily cut, such as testing and scalable design falls by the wayside.

Using certain technology can allow for debugging and resolution of production systems on the fly without down time.

## History
We started on this project in late 2013 but due to life/work/opportunities it went on the backburner.

Orginally the tooling was written in Java but the new focus is on Kotlin.

# Utilities
All utilities are focuses around the paradigms of static factories. Clean single line commands that are not verbose or terse but expressive of intent.

## Dialog
## Appfont

# Data
It is better to have a single model where you may manipulate in 100 ways then to have 10 models that can be manpulated 10 times each. This aids in overall system simplicity and lowers complexity.

## MapObject
### (de)Serialisation

# API
These methods think of a request in a kind of jQuery form but in Android.
## Requester
